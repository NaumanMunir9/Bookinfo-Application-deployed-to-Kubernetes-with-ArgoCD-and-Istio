# Bookinfo Application deployed to Kubernetes with ArgoCD and Istio

[Istio Documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/examples/bookinfo/)

## About the Application

- This example deploys a sample application composed of four separate microservices used to demonstrate various Istio features.

The application displays information about a book, similar to a single catalog entry of an online book store. Displayed on the page is a description of the book, book details (ISBN, number of pages, and so on), and a few book reviews.

The Bookinfo application is broken into four separate microservices:

- **Productpage:** The productpage microservice calls the details and reviews microservices to populate the page.
- **details:** The details microservice contains book information.
- **reviews:** The reviews microservice contains book reviews. It also calls the ratings microservice.
- **ratings:** The ratings microservice contains book ranking information that accompanies a book review.

There are 3 versions of the reviews microservice:

1. Version v1 doesn’t call the ratings service.
2. Version v2 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 black stars.
3. Version v3 calls the ratings service, and displays each rating as 1 to 5 red stars.

## Application Architecture

This application is polyglot, i.e., the microservices are written in different languages. It’s worth noting that these services have no dependencies on Istio, but make an interesting service mesh example, particularly because of the multitude of services, languages and versions for the reviews service.

### Setup Local Kubernetes Environment (KinD) with LoadBalancer (Metallb)

Please refer to the following github repo for setting up a local kubernetes environment using KinD and LoadBalancer using Metallb.

## Project WorkFlow

### Installing ArgoCD

```shell
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

```shell
k get all -n argocd
```

---

### Change the service type of "argocd-server" from "ClusterIP" to LoadBalancer

For the argocd to utilize Metallb, we have to change the service type of "argocd-server" service from "ClusterIP" to "LoadBalancer"

```shell
k edit service argocd-server -n argocd
```

```shell
k get all -n argocd
```

**Now we see that the service type of "argocd-server" service has been changed from "ClusterIP" to "LoadBalancer".**

### Login ArgoCD Web Interface

- ArgoCD UI admin **username**: *admin*
- ArgoCD UI admin **password**: *xxxxxxxxxxxx*

##### For retrieving ArgoCD UI admin password, paste the following command in the terminal:

```shell
k -n argocd get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```
